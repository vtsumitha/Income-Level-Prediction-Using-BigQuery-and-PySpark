# Income Level Prediction Using BigQuery and PySpark

This was the final project for Spring 2022 Big Data Course

The goal is to train a binary classification model using PySpark that will predict if a person earns more than 50,000 USD per year (target variable) based on the census information like education, employment, work class, number of working hours, etc. I will be using the publicly available census dataset from the Google Cloud Platform. This uses the United States Census Income Dataset provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about people from a 1994 Census database, including age, education, marital status, occupation, and from which we will predict if people earn more than $50,000 a year. Employed various big data concepts for making this prediction.
